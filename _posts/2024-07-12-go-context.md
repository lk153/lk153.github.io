# Context in Go

## What is Context?

`context` package is a fundamental tool designed to:

1. Manage and share request-scoped data
2. Cancellation signal across different layers of an application
3. Timeouts or deadlines across different layers of an application

Imagine a `context` as a special carrier bag that holds all the necessary information and instructions for a specific task. This bag can be passed from function to function, ensuring everyone involved has the same context (information) and can act accordingly. It can also contain a self-destruct button (cancellation signal) to stop the operation if needed.

## Why do we need Context?

The need for a `Context` arises from the fact that many operations in a program are asynchronous, concurrent, or dependent on external systems. In such cases, it’s essential to have a way to propagate cancellation signals, deadlines, and request-scoped data across multiple functions and goroutines.

***1. The Coffee Shop Analogy***

Imagine you’re the person taking orders in a bustling coffee shop. When an drink order arrives, you assign it to one of your skilled barista. But what if the customer suddenly decides to leave? Without hesitation, you’d inform the barista to stop processing that drink to avoid wasting coffee. This scenario mirrors how context works in Go.

- ***Cancellation Propagation***: In the coffee shop analogy, the customer leaving corresponds to a cancellation signal. Similarly, in Go, context allows graceful propagation of cancellation signals. When a parent operation (e.g., an HTTP request handler) cancels, all related child operations (e.g., database queries or API calls) terminate promptly. This prevents resource leaks and ensures efficient cleanup.

***2. Handling Slow APIs and Timeouts***

Suppose your application makes web requests to external APIs or runs system commands. In production-grade systems, it’s essential to set timeouts. Here’s why:

- ***API Dependency***: Imagine your service relies on an external API. If that API is running slowly or becomes unresponsive, you wouldn’t want your system to back up with pending requests. A timeout ensures that if the API call exceeds a specified duration, the associated context cancels, allowing your application to gracefully handle the situation.
- ***Performance Degradation***: Without timeouts, slow external dependencies can lead to a cascading effect. Backlogged requests increase load, degrade performance, and impact overall system responsiveness. By using context with deadlines, you can prevent this issue.

## Uses of Context:

***1. Propagating Trace IDs Across Distributed Services***

The `context` package allows you to propagate trace IDs and other metadata across service boundaries, ensuring consistent logging and tracing information throughout the request's lifecycle.

***2. Passing Authentication Tokens***

In many applications, authentication tokens or user information needs to be passed through different layers of the application. The `context` package provides a clean way to handle this, ensuring that authentication information is available where needed without polluting function signatures with additional parameters.

***3. WebSocket and Streaming APIs***

In WebSocket and streaming APIs, `Context` is used to manage the lifetime of the connection and propagate request-scoped data, such as the user ID and session information. This allows you to implement features like authentication, rate limiting, and session management efficiently.

## Different Types of Context in Go:

***1. Background Context - TODO Context***

This is the most basic context and serves as an empty starting point. It doesn’t carry any cancellation signal or deadline. Use it when no specific context is required.

The only time `TODO` is used instead of `Background` is when the implementation is unclear, or the context is not yet known.

Typically used in main functions, initialization, and tests.

    ctx := context.Background()
    ctx2 := context.TODO()

***2. context.WithCancel***

Creates a new context derived from a parent context., `WithCancel` method returns a copy of the parent context along with a cancel function; invoking the cancel function releases resources connected with the context and should be called as soon as operations in the Context type are finally completed.

Used to cancel operations in a goroutine when certain conditions are met.

    parentCtx := context.Background()
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(parentCtx)
    defer cancel() // Clean up resources

***3. context.WithDeadline***

Similar to setting a deadline for oneself, you can set a deadline for context. Go will automatically cancel the context for you if the time limit you specified for it to finish is reached. It creates a new context derived from a parent context with a specific deadline.

Useful when you have a specific deadline for completing an operation.

    parentCtx := context.Background()
    deadline := time.Now().Add(10 * time.Second)
    ctx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(parentCtx, deadline)
    defer cancel() // Clean up resources

***4. context.WithValue***

Creates a new context derived from a parent context with an associated key-value pair. This allows you to store and retrieve request-specific information within the context. `WithValue` accepts a parent context and returns a context copy. As a result, rather than overwriting the value, it creates a new duplicate with a new key-value pair.

Useful for passing request-scoped data through the context, such as authentication tokens or trace IDs.

    parentCtx := context.Background()
    userIDKey := "auth-token"
    ctx := context.WithValue(parentCtx, userIDKey, "abc123")

***5. context.WithTimeout***

Creates a context with an associated timeout. The context cancels automatically after the specified duration. `WithTimeout`, allows a program to continue where it might otherwise hang, giving the end user a better experience. It accepts a brief period as a parameter, along with the parent context, and terminates the function if it runs beyond the timeout period.

Useful for setting deadlines on operations.

    parentCtx := context.Background()
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(parentCtx, 5*time.Second)
    defer cancel() // Clean up resources

## Conclusion
When it comes to program design, the Golang context package is an extremely useful tool. Context in Go serves as a powerful tool for managing request-scoped data, cancellation signals, and deadlines. Whether you’re building microservices, APIs, or web applications, context ensures clean resource handling and consistent behaviour.
