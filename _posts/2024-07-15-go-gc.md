# Go Garbage Collector

## Introduction

*(This post currently describes the garbage collector as of **Go 1.19**)*

This post help you in better understanding your application costs by providing insights into the Go garbage collector (**GC**). By the way, It also provides guidance on how to *improve your application s' resource utilization*. It does not assume any knowledge of **GC**, but does assume familiarity with the Go programming language.

1/ Go language takes responsibility for arranging the storage of Go values. These values often need to be stored in computer `physical memory`, it is a finite resource. Due to its finite, memory must be managed carefully and recycled in order to avoid running out of it while executing a Go program.

2/ At a high level, a **GC** is a system that recycles memory on behalf of the application by identifying which parts of memory are no longer needed
