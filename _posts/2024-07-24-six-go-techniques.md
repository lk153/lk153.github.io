# 6 Unique & Lesser-known Go Techniques

## Generate
This tool automates code generation, saving you time and reducing mistakes. With go generate, you can add special comments in your code to run specific commands, which is great for creating boilerplate code.
```go
//go:generate stringer -type=Status
type Status int

const (
    Active Status = iota
    Inactive
    Pending
)
```
In this example, the `//go:generate` comment tells the Go tool to run the `stringer` command, which generates a string representation for the `Status` constants. This can be incredibly useful when you need a consistent way to convert constants to their string values throughout your codebase.
```go
//go:generate mockgen -source=interface.go -destination=mock/interface_mock.go -package=mock
type MyInterface interface {
    DoSomething(param string) error
}
```
In this example, the `//go:generate` comment runs the `mockgen` tool to generate a mock implementation of `MyInterface`. This is very useful for testing, as it allows you to create mock objects automatically.
```go
//go:generate protoc --go_out=. --go-grpc_out=. myproto.proto
```
Here, `//go:generate` runs the `protoc` command to compile Protocol Buffers definitions into Go code. This is essential for applications that use gRPC for communication.

One more thing about generators: how to manage your tool versions. because we’ve already pinned the dependencies and their versions in our *go.mod* file, we can achieve this through the declaration in the `tools.go` file.
```go 
//go:build tools
// +build tools

package main

import (
 _ "golang.org/x/tools/cmd/stringer"
)
```
This brings us to the next technique:

## Build tags
Build tags provide a powerful way to include or exclude files from the build process based on specific conditions. They can be particularly useful for managing different build environments or conditional compilation. Let’s dive into how build tags work and how they can be used effectively in your Go projects.

Build tags are special comments in Go that control when a file should be included in the package. In this case:

- New syntax
```go
//go:build tools
```

- Old syntax
```go
// +build tools
```

# Functional Options Pattern
Consider developing a web server framework where users need to configure various parameters like host, port, timeouts, and security settings. The Function Options pattern allows users to specify only the options they care about, providing default values for the rest. This makes your API user-friendly and reduces the risk of breaking changes if new configuration options are added in the future.

This pattern provides a flexible way to handle configuration in your functions and constructors. Instead of creating multiple constructors or using complex parameter lists, the Function Options pattern allows you to use options as functions that modify the configuration of your struct.
```go
type Server struct {
    Host string
    Port int
}

type Option func(*Server)

func WithHost(host string) Option {
    return func(s *Server) { s.Host = host }
}

func WithPort(port int) Option {
    return func(s *Server) { s.Port = port }
}

func NewServer(opts ...Option) *Server {
    server := &Server{Host: "localhost", Port: 8080}
    for _, opt := range opts { opt(server) }
    return server
}

func main() {
    server := NewServer(WithHost("example.com"), WithPort(9090))
    fmt.Printf("Server running at %s:%d\n", server.Host, server.Port)
}
```
In this example, we have a `Server` struct with default values for `Host` and `Port`. The `Option` type is a function that modifies the server configuration. Functions like `WithHost` and `WithPort` return these options, which can then be passed to the `NewServer` function to customize the server's configuration. This pattern is very clean and makes it easy to add new configuration options without breaking existing code.

### Comparing to the Builder Pattern
let’s compare the Function Options pattern with the Builder pattern. The Builder pattern involves creating a separate Builder struct to handle the configuration and then constructing the final object. Here’s how it looks in Go:
```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

// Server struct with configuration fields
type Server struct {
    Host string
    Port int
}

// ServerBuilder struct for building Server instances
type ServerBuilder struct {
    host string
    port int
}

// NewServerBuilder initializes a new ServerBuilder with default values
func NewServerBuilder() *ServerBuilder {
    return &ServerBuilder{
        host: "localhost",
        port: 8080,
    }
}

// SetHost sets the Host of the server
func (b *ServerBuilder) SetHost(host string) *ServerBuilder {
    b.host = host
    return b
}

// SetPort sets the Port of the server
func (b *ServerBuilder) SetPort(port int) *ServerBuilder {
    b.port = port
    return b
}

// Build constructs the Server with the provided configuration
func (b *ServerBuilder) Build() *Server {
    return &Server{
        Host: b.host,
        Port: b.port,
    }
}

func main() {
    builder := NewServerBuilder()
    server := builder.SetHost("example.com").SetPort(9090).Build()
    fmt.Printf("Server running at %s:%d\n", server.Host, server.Port)
}
```
In this example, the `ServerBuilder` struct is responsible for configuring and constructing the `Server`. Each configuration method, like `SetHost` and `SetPort`, returns the builder itself, allowing for method chaining. Finally, the `Build` method constructs the `Server` instance with the configured values.

For most Go applications, the Function Options pattern is more **idiomatic** and aligns well with Go’s **simplicity** and **flexibility**.

## Error Wrapping
 You often need to provide context for what went wrong. This is where error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` comes in handy. It allows you to add context to your errors, making debugging much easier.
 ```go
 func doSomething() error {
    err := someFunction()
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("doSomething failed: %w", err)
    }
    return nil
}
```
In this example, if `someFunction` returns an error, we wrap it with additional context using `fmt.Errorf`. The `%w` verb is used to include the original error. This wrapped error provides a complete picture of what went wrong, making it easier to trace the source of the problem.

## Using Context for Cancellation
Using context for cancellation, you can gracefully handle client cancellations (e.g., if the user navigates away from the page) and avoid wasting resources on operations that are no longer needed. This improves the efficiency and responsiveness of your server.

By passing a context through your functions, you can signal cancellation across goroutines and control the lifespan of operations. This improves resource management and ensures that your application can respond to changes promptly.
```go
func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
    defer cancel()

    go func() {
        time.Sleep(2 * time.Second)
        cancel()
    }()

    <-ctx.Done()
    fmt.Println("Operation canceled:", ctx.Err())
}
```
In this example, we create a context with a `cancel` function. A goroutine simulates some work and then calls `cancel` to signal that the operation should be canceled. The main function waits for the context to be canceled by `<-ctx.Done()` and then prints the cancellation error. This pattern allows you to handle cancellations gracefully and avoid wasting resources on unnecessary operations.

```go
func main() {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 2*time.Second)
    defer cancel()

    select {
    case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Operation timed out")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Context canceled:", ctx.Err())
    }
}
```
Using `context.WithTimeout`, you can set a timeout for operations. If the operation takes longer than the specified time, the context will be canceled automatically.

```go
func main() {
    deadline := time.Now().Add(2 * time.Second)
    ctx, cancel := context.WithDeadline(context.Background(), deadline)
    defer cancel()

    select {
    case <-time.After(3 * time.Second):
        fmt.Println("Operation timed out")
    case <-ctx.Done():
        fmt.Println("Context canceled:", ctx.Err())
    }
}
```
Similarly, `context.WithDeadline` allows you to set a specific time at which the context will be canceled, providing even more control over your operations.

## JSON Tagging for Structs
Imagine you’re building a RESTful API that returns user data. Some fields, like passwords or internal IDs, should not be exposed to clients for security reasons. By using **JSON** tags, you can control the visibility of struct fields, ensuring that sensitive information is never sent in the API response. This approach helps maintain `data privacy and security` while providing a clean and consistent API interface.

Customizing **JSON** encoding and decoding with struct tags can give you precise control over how your data is marshaled and unmarshaled. This is particularly useful for APIs where you need to ensure that the JSON output matches specific requirements and excludes sensitive information.
```go
type User struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Email string `json:"email,omitempty"`
    Age   int    `json:"-"`
}
```
1. `omitempty`: Omits the field from JSON if it has an empty value (zero value for the type).
2. `-`: Completely excludes the field from JSON encoding and decoding.
3. `json:"name,string"`: Encodes/decodes the field as a JSON string, useful for numeric fields that need to be strings in JSON.
4. `json:"name,omitempty,string"`: Combines omitempty and string encoding/decoding.
