# Software development outsourcing checklist — how to ensure success

## Principles of successful development projects

Leveraging a trusted development partner can help you expedite your product roadmap and adoption of new technologies, however, these projects take thoughtful planning and structure to execute successfully. This software development outsourcing checklist outlines many of the key practices that are critical to success and are built on the following key principles:

- Simplicity (KISS)
- Business value and alignment to priorities
- Quality throughout
- Leadership and team commitment and accountability
- Rapid and iterative delivery
- Collaboration and transparency
- Continuous improvement and waste elimination

## Project scope and goals
Defining clear objectives and scope of the project helps to focus on specific measurable deliverables that define its success, thus allowing for clear alignment of all stakeholders.
- The project **scope**, **goals** and **business case** are documented with transparency to all team members, both internal and external.
- All epics / features are identified and stack-ranked in order of importance for the project so the team has a clear sense of the key deliverables and priorities.
- Each epic / feature is defined, including **target customer(s)** and **measurable customer criteria**, so the team understands at a general level what is critical for each key deliverable
- **Technical architecture** for the product is defined, including key components and technologies that will be used, so the team has a high-level understanding of how the project will be built
- **Project schedule** is broken down into increments of **no more than three months**, and further broken down into individual iterations of **no more than 2 weeks** so that the project deliverables are scoped to **manageable** durations
- **Standard and consistent estimate techniques** are used on each epic/feature to appropriately and consistently size key deliverables, with buffers added to account for unknown items and risks.
- **Acceptance criteria and non-functional requirements (performance, scale, availability etc.)** are defined for the project and are they reasonably measurable by the project team.
- Project risks have been identified and plans in place to mitigate potential risks and / or resolve risk early in the project.
- The **project scope**, **goals** and **priorities** are commonly understood and agreed upon by all team members, including key stakeholders and the outsource development team.
- **Key leaders of the external-outsource team** actively participated in the development of the project scope, goals, estimate, etc. while co-located with the internal team during this phase.

## Delivery team
Being intentional about team design, roles and responsibilities is key to successful collaboration and accountability.

- All team members are identified along with their **respective roles** and **responsibilities** so the entire team (both internal and external) know each other and understand how they will **collaborate**.
- For the internal teams, these critical roles have been identified and resourced appropriately
    - **Product Manager** is responsible for the overall **project direction**, **customer requirements** and priorities for the development team. They are also responsible for the customer validation plan and coordination with project stakeholders.
    - **Architectural representative** is the architectural contact for the outsourced team, and is responsible for consistent architecture across products and features.
    - **Stakeholders** are leadership representatives responsible for overall project success.
- For the external (outsource team) have these critical roles been staffed
    - **Technical Leader** is ultimate responsibility is for technical advice and programming of the outsource development team and partner with the client architect team to ensure architectural consistency.
    - **Product Owner** is to partner with the client product management team and is responsible for breaking down and refining user stories and acceptance criteria and coordinating with the development team.

- The external development team has the right mix of resource / talent between product owner, developers and testers
- The external teams are co-located and broken down into individual teams no greater than seven people
- The leaders of the internal and external team worked together to **determine** and **agree** on **roles and responsibilities** for key product development **deliverables**?
