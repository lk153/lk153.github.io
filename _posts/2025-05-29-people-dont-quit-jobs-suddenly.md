People don’t quit jobs suddenly. Here’s what a slow exit really looks like.

Quitting doesn't start with a resignation letter. It starts with a slow exit you never saw coming.

The real resignation starts in the mind. Silence is the first sign of quitting.

People don’t just quit jobs. They quit caring first.

Long before someone submits their resignation, they’ve already started to check out emotionally.

The decline doesn’t happen overnight, it happens in silence.

Here’s what that slow exit often looks like:
1. They stop sharing new ideas
2. They do only what’s required, nothing more
3. They stay quiet in meetings
4. They show up late, leave early
5. They no longer defend their work
6. They avoid conversations with leadership
7. They stop asking for feedback
8. They mentally disconnect
9. They start looking elsewhere
10. They finally give up, and then give notice

This is why people-first leadership matters.
When employees feel seen, valued, and trusted; they thrive.

But when they feel unheard, unsupported, or replaceable; they detach.

If someone used to care, and now they don’t…
- That’s not on them.
- That’s on the environment.

What’s one silent sign you’ve seen before someone quits?
